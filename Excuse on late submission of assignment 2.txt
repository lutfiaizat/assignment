The reason for my late submission of the assignment 2 is because I have to go back home 
last Thursday night in Seremban because of my cousin's death from medical condition(chronic
cerebral palsy).
And I went back to the campus on the following morning (5 a.m). During those time, I 
travels a lot back and forth so I have very limited time with divided focus to complete
the assignment and to attend to my family.
